    "In <<chapter_intro>> we saw that deep learning can be used to get great results with natural language datasets. Our example relied on using a pretrained language model and fine-tuning it to classify reviews. That example highlighted a difference between transfer learning in NLP and computer vision: in general in NLP the pretrained model is trained on a different task.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we call a language model is a model that has been trained to guess what the next word in a text is (having read the ones before). This kind of task is called *self-supervised learning*: we do not need to give labels to our model, just feed it lots and lots of texts. It has a process to automatically get labels from the data, and this task isn't trivial: to properly guess the next word in a sentence, the model will have to develop an understanding of the English (or other) language. Self-supervised learning can also be used in other domains; for instance, see [\"Self-Supervised Learning and Computer Vision\"](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) for an introduction to vision applications. Self-supervised learning is not usually used for the model that is trained directly, but instead is used for pretraining a model used for transfer learning."

    "The language model we used in <<chapter_intro>> to classify IMDb reviews was pretrained on Wikipedia. We got great results by directly fine-tuning this language model to a movie review classifier, but with one extra step, we can do even better. The Wikipedia English is slightly different from the IMDb English, so instead of jumping directly to the classifier, we could fine-tune our pretrained language model to the IMDb corpus and then use *that* as the base for our classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if our language model knows the basics of the language we are using in the task (e.g., our pretrained model is in English), it helps to get used to the style of the corpus we are targeting. It may be more informal language, or more technical, with new words to learn or different ways of composing sentences. In the case of the IMDb dataset, there will be lots of names of movie directors and actors, and often a less formal style of language than that seen in Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already saw that with fastai, we can download a pretrained English language model and use it to get state-of-the-art results for NLP classification. (We expect pretrained models in many more languages to be available soon—they might well be available by the time you are reading this book, in fact.) So, why are we learning how to train a language model in detail?\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason, of course, is that it is helpful to understand the foundations of the models that you are using. But there is another very practical reason, which is that you get even better results if you fine-tune the (sequence-based) language model prior to fine-tuning the classification model. For instance, for the IMDb sentiment analysis task, the dataset includes 50,000 additional movie reviews that do not have any positive or negative labels attached. Since there are 25,000 labeled reviews in the training set and 25,000 in the validation set, that makes 100,000 movie reviews altogether. We can use all of these reviews to fine-tune the pretrained language model, which was trained only on Wikipedia articles; this will result in a language model that is particularly good at predicting the next word of a movie review.\n",

    "This is known as the Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFit) approach. The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) showed that this extra stage of fine-tuning of the language model, prior to transfer learning to a classification task, resulted in significantly better predictions. Using this approach, we have three stages for transfer learning in NLP, as summarized in <<ulmfit_process>>."

Word tokenization relies on an assumption that spaces provide a useful separation of components of meaning in a sentence. However, this assumption is not always appropriate. For instance, consider this sentence: 我的名字是郝杰瑞 (\"My name is Jeremy Howard\" in Chinese). That's not going to work very well with a word tokenizer, because there are no spaces in it! Languages like Chinese and Japanese don't use spaces, and in fact they don't even have a well-defined concept of a \"word.\" There are also languages, like Turkish and Hungarian, that can add many subwords together without spaces, creating very long words that include a lot of separate pieces of information.\n",

       "((#200) ['Watching this odd little adventure movie, it\\'s hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality Giallo classics as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh and The Case of the Scorpion\\'s Tail, but it has to be said that despite it\\'s low quality production values, Island of the Fish Men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than it\\'s getting. Like many Italian films from the seventies, this is one is a rip off of a successful American film, the one in question this time being the critically panned Island of Dr Moreau. Sergio Martino\\'s film takes ideas such as mutation, greed and adventure and moulds it into one slightly compelling film, which makes up for what it\\'s lacks in coherency and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas. The central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island. It quickly becomes apparent that not everything about this place is normal, and it soon transpires that half of the population has been turned into \"fish men\" - a cross between a man and a fish, which exist for purely selfish reasons...<br /><br />The truth about this movie is that it\\'s a lot more fun if you ignore the trashy production values. The central monsters look completely ridiculous, and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost someone a few pennies - but the movie is well shot in spite of this, with the underwater photography being a particular highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done in that the film never becomes boring. The way that the plot comes together isn\\'t exactly genius, but it takes in a lot of ideas and I\\'ve seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one. The biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I\\'m not a massive fan of adventure movies, and therefore don\\'t see this lost city get mentioned much - but it is always nice to see it in a movie. The central island location is good in that it provides an apt setting for the story and also provides the movie with the right amount of mystery, as Martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. Overall, this isn\\'t exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one.',\"Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria. However, three things complement the story, making this an extremely good movie.<br /><br />First, the actors use the actual languages of their roles. The Russian soldiers speak only Russian; the Hungarians only Hungarian; the Germans only German, except to the minimal extent to tell the story. Since Debra Kerr is English, she speaks only English, and, of course, Yul Brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English. As a result, the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when he/she cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them. Very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience, and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages, the audience is never at a loss for following the film. No subtitles are necessary.<br /><br />Second. I was in Hungary in 1995, and I'm telling you, this movie has it right on. From the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes, the realism is incredible. If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie, I ate at its double. I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village. (Actually, the film was shot in Austria).<br /><br />Third, and most important, this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified. Of course, Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship, so the Acadamy wasn't going to give him another one, but that is the quality of the film. Don't miss this one.\",'Well done melodrama that tells the story of Sally, tomboy dancer in the circus, raised by sideshow performer McGargle (played by W.C. Fields), he of the top hat, little mustache, checkered pants, and proficiency as juggler, pickpocket, and runner of carnival con games like Three Card Monte and the Old Shell Game. McGargle has raised Sally, who worships him as her \"real father\" since Sally\\'s mother (kicked out of her home by her father, a judge, when she married a \"circus man\") died and left Sally orphaned. Sally is feisty and loyal to McGargle no matter what he gets up to - but McGargle seems to feel a bit of guilt over keeping her in the circus instead of with her own family all these years. When they end up performing in a carnival in the town where her wealthy grandparents live, McGargle uses the opportunity to \"investigate\" Sally\\'s real family, with the idea that he may restore her to them. But grandfather the judge takes an immediate disliking to Sally \\'cause he doesn\\'t like a \"show girl\" - what a stern, narrow-minded man he is, a real piece of work that guy! And meanwhile Sally is busy being pursued by a handsome and rich young man, son of the man who helped grandpa get his riches.<br /><br />This is a very good film with a few laughs here and there and a sort of odd editing style (I don\\'t know how to describe this other than it shows long shots, then sort of jumps back a few seconds or changes angle suddenly as a close up is shown). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is delightful here - quite cute and comical in her performance. W.C. Fields, even without his famous voice, is very funny - just the way he moves and his amusing, comical reactions to things (like a small dog seen in one funny scene), we even see him juggling briefly in this. I love the few peeks at the old-fashioned circus and carnival that is shown here. The print of this featured on the DVD is very nice looking, tinted a light sepia tone, and the piano score for this is really excellent, performed by Philip Carli based on the original cue sheets.','I liked this show from the first episode I saw, which was the \"Rhapsody in Blue\" episode (for those that don\\'t know what that is, the Zan going insane and becoming pau lvl 10 ep). Best visuals and special effects I\\'ve seen on a television series, nothing like it anywhere.',\"I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from tearing all over the place. <br /><br />The chemistry between Richard gere and Diane lane was very believable (fantastic acting on both parts)! I loved how Diane lane's daughter acted in the show too. She displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life. <br /><br />I loved this show from start to end. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!\",'Some films are designed to just entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or uplift, others, like this, aim to provoke, to make you think, and to make you angry. I was angry during this film, not at the film, but at the fact that it was true, that America, the free, does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good. The torture scenes in this movie were harrowing, the indifference of people was shattering, the film was compelling in its argument, and showed just how wrong it is to torture people. Of course now that makes me a \"bleeding liberal\" labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not. People who don\\'t realise that as the movie said, for every person tortured,you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance. You get an ever increasing cycle of violence. This film did not make me hate America, although I can see how it could do, but it made me hate the way that America has reacted in its post 9/11 world. There is a significant quote in the film, just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene, the quote is \"one American is dead\" - that makes the difference. You cannot kill an American, America can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single American, or they will do whatever it takes, including torture to enact justice. This is the American way apparently. Call me a liberal, call me naive (although I think the people who think torture is fine are naive) call me deluded, call me anything you like, but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in America and the west today. I wish this film would be shown to all school students, at a minimum. This film will stay with me a long time, part of me wishes I could forget it, because I wish this type of thing never happened, but I know it does, the other part of me wishes I would never forget, because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. Whatever happens to me, this film will be with me for a long time, and I will be telling everyone I know to watch it, not to be entertained, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all need to be provoked.',\"This is definitely a girl movie. My husband found it utterly boring, but I think this is a really sweet movie. It's amazing to think that just a note can bring so many people together. This is a great get-away for anyone who loves a cute, funny romance!\",'I don\\'t usually comment on films since I am in the movie distribution business, but I have to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The acting is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of handicapped people to try and make this movie more \"Hollywood\". James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Steven Robertson as well. I cannot believe this is his first real film. Brenda Fricker plays a small role, but as usual, she is outstanding. This is a movie for everyone to see just how lucky we all are. If you like Awakenings and Mask, you will enjoy this story. You owe it to yourself to check this film out.','Cactus Flower is what I call a \"pizza movie\" -A personal favorite that never fails to satisfy. Perfect for an evening at home with a pizza. Knowing all the lines (and what lines!) by heart only enhances the enjoyment.<br /><br />Since so many others here have retold the plot, I\\'ll simply add the correction that Bergman\\'s character, Miss Dickinson, was a nurse-receptionist, meaning she was a skilled nurse -and therefore an educated person -not \"just\" a receptionist.<br /><br />Bergman\\'s performance in this film -and the film itself- was largely dismissed at the time, but today\\'s audiences will marvel at her range; not just the impeccable comic timing, but the ability to make us believe her character is unaware of her own feelings while revealing them so clearly to Toni and to us. While the general plot stretches credibility, Bergman\\'s performance is compelling: honest and utterly believable.<br /><br />Also a standout is Jack Weston\\'s performance as the Matthau\\'s old friend and co-conspirator, Harvey. No one could deliver a zinger like Weston, and I.A.L. Diamond\\'s script gives him plenty. For example: \"That\\'s such a big, dirty, rotten lie it has class.\" Weston excelled at slightly seedy characters because he exuded a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters\\' flaws. <br /><br />The film is a fairly straight adaptation of the Abe Burrows play (which was itself adapted from a French play by Barillet and Gredy). On Broadway Matthau\\'s role was played by Barry Nelson. Bergman\\'s by Lauren Bacall, and Hawn\\'s by Brenda Vaccaro. It ran for 1,234 performances (three years) and was nominated for two Tony Awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff, who played Igor).<br /><br />For me, the film\\'s score, written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones is another highlight. The main theme (A Time For Love Is Anytime) is performed by Sarah Vaughn over the opening and closing credits. It is also insinuated in different arrangements throughout the film, most notably as the romantic piano music underscoring Berman\\'s speech to Hawn in the record store. Jones also created covers of popular songs from the period (To Sir With Love, I\\'m A Believer) for the night club scenes. As with all of the film\\'s elements, there is a tremendous amount of talent, taste, and professionalism evident. <br /><br />In my opinion, few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic. It\\'s great to finally have it available on DVD. Time to call for a pizza...','Not your ordinary movie, but a good one. Billy Bob is very funny in this movie, the way he talks, what he says etc. I was kind of surprised when i saw it, cause i just thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that.

    "Our special rules tokens appear first, and then every word appears once, in frequency order. The defaults to `Numericalize` are `min_freq=3,max_vocab=60000`. `max_vocab=60000` results in fastai replacing all words other than the most common 60,000 with a special *unknown word* token, `xxunk`. This is useful to avoid having an overly large embedding matrix, since that can slow down training and use up too much memory, and can also mean that there isn't enough data to train useful representations for rare words. However, this last issue is better handled by setting `min_freq`; the default `min_freq=3` means that any word appearing less than three times is replaced with `xxunk`.\n",

    "Going back to our movie reviews dataset, the first step is to transform the individual texts into a stream by concatenating them together. As with images, it's best to randomize the order of the inputs, so at the beginning of each epoch we will shuffle the entries to make a new stream (we shuffle the order of the documents, not the order of the words inside them, or the texts would not make sense anymore!).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then cut this stream into a certain number of batches (which is our *batch size*). For instance, if the stream has 50,000 tokens and we set a batch size of 10, this will give us 10 mini-streams of 5,000 tokens. What is important is that we preserve the order of the tokens (so from 1 to 5,000 for the first mini-stream, then from 5,001 to 10,000...), because we want the model to read continuous rows of text (as in the preceding example). An `xxbos` token is added at the start of each during preprocessing, so that the model knows when it reads the stream when a new entry is beginning.\n",

    "So to recap, at every epoch we shuffle our collection of documents and concatenate them into a stream of tokens. We then cut that stream into a batch of fixed-size consecutive mini-streams. Our model will then read the mini-streams in order, and thanks to an inner state, it will produce the same activation whatever sequence length we picked.\n",

This should sound familiar: we had the same issue with images. In that case, we used cropping, padding, and/or squishing to make all the inputs the same size. Cropping might not be a good idea for documents, because it seems likely we'd remove some key information (having said that, the same issue is true for images, and we use cropping there; data augmentation hasn't been well explored for NLP yet, so perhaps there are actually opportunities to use cropping in NLP too!).

Additionally, to avoid memory issues and improve performance, we will batch together texts that are roughly the same lengths (with some shuffling for the training set). We do this by (approximately, for the training set) sorting the documents by length prior to each epoch. The result of this is that the documents collated into a single batch will tend to be of similar lengths. We won't pad every batch to the same size, but will instead use the size of the largest document in each batch as the target size. (It is possible to do something similar with images, which is especially useful for irregularly sized rectangular images, but at the time of writing no library provides good support for this yet, and there aren't any papers covering it.

In his article [\"More than a Million Pro-Repeal Net Neutrality Comments Were Likely Faked\"](https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6), he reports how he discovered a large cluster of comments opposing net neutrality that seemed to have been generated by some sort of Mad Libs-style mail merge. In <<disinformation>>, the fake comments have been helpfully color-coded by Kao to highlight their formulaic nature."

    "Given advances in language modeling that have occurred since 2017, such fraudulent campaigns could be nearly impossible to catch now.  You now have all the necessary tools at your disposal to create a compelling language model—that is, something that can generate context-appropriate, believable text. It won't necessarily be perfectly accurate or correct, but it will be plausible. Think about what this technology would mean when put together with the kinds of disinformation campaigns we have learned about in recent years. Take a look at the Reddit dialogue shown in <<ethics_reddit>>, where a language model based on OpenAI's GPT-2 algorithm is having a conversation with itself about whether the US government should cut defense spending."

In such a situation we could easily imagine getting to a point where the vast majority of discourse online was from bots, and nobody would have any idea that it was happening.\n",

We saw two types of models: language models that can generate texts, and a classifier that determines if a review is positive or negative. To build a state-of-the art classifier, we used a pretrained language model, fine-tuned it to the corpus of our task, then used its body (the encoder) with a new head to do the classification.\n",
